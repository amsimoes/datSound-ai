# datSound

Music Recommender System based on Spotify's API and AI techniques.

Tracks, Events and New Releases (Albums) are recommended based on User's Spotify history.

# Installation

It's a CLI application and all we used was Python (2.7 version).

Apart from Python 2.7, requirements can be met by doing the following command:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Running

Running and exploring the application is naturally intuitive.

`$ python2 agent.py`

Navigation inside the menus is done through number inputs (0 - 9).
